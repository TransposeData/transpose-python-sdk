## SDK Documentation
You can learn more about the Transpose SDK and how it works below.

### Updating Chain ID
If you want to change the chain ID of your query, you can do so by setting the `chain_id` or `chain` properties of the `Transpose` object. For example, if you want to query the Ethereum mainnet, you can do so by running the following code:

```python
from transpose import Transpose
api = Transpose(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", chain_id=1)
```

or
```python
from transpose import Transpose
api = Transpose(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", chain_id="ethereum")
```

if you wish to change the chain ID of an existing `Transpose` object, you can do so by running the following code:

```python
api.set_chain("ethereum")
```

or 

```python
api.set_chain(1)
```

#### Currently supported chains
| Chain ID | Chain Name |
| :------: | :--------: |
|    1     |  Ethereum  |
|   137    |  Polygon   |

### SDK Classes
The Transpose SDK uses custom classes to represent API responses:

#### Error Classes
<details>
<summary>SDK Error Class Specifications</summary>
The SDK uses the following error classes to represent API errors:

- ``TransposeBadRequest``
  - Represents a 400 Bad Request error from the Transpose API.
- ``TransposeRateLimit``
  - Represents a 429 Rate Limit error from the Transpose API.
- ``TransposeInvalidAPIKey``
  - Represents a 401 Unauthorized error from the Transpose API.
- ``TransposeInternalServerError``
  - Represents a 500 Internal Server Error error from the Transpose API.
- ``TransposeResourceNotFound``
  - Represents a 404 Not Found error from the Transpose API.

These errors will be raised when the SDK encounters an error from the Transpose API.
</details>

#### Response Classes
<details>
<summary>Response Class Specifications</summary>

The SDK will always return a list of response objects from the Transpose API. For example, calling the ``ens.records_by_date`` endpoint will return a list of ``ENSRecord`` objects.

These response objects can be accessed in the following ways:
  - ``ENSRecord[0].ens_name`` will return the first record's ens_name.
  - ``ENSRecord[i].ens_name`` retrieves the ens_name from the i-th response
  
All response objects can also be accessed as a dictionary by calling ``.to_dict()`` on them:
  - ``ENSRecord[0].to_dict()`` will return the first record as a dictionary.
  - ``ENSRecord[i].to_dict()`` retrieves the i-th record as a dictionary.
</details>

### Pagination
<details>
<summary>Pagination with the Transpose SDK.</summary>

Transpose endpoints will return a maximum of 500 results in a single query. To return the next page, simply call ``api.next()``. If ``api.next()`` returns ``None``, then there are no more pages.

Here is a standard pagination implementation:

```python
while True:
    data = api.next()

    # sleep to avoid rate limits
    time.sleep(1)

    # if there are no more pages, exit loop
    if data is None: break

    # otherwise, print length of data
    else: print(len(data))
```
</details>

### Bulk Requests
<details>

<summary>Bulk requesting data with the Transpose SDK</summary>
Alongside pagination, we also offer a convenience method for iterating over all pages. This method will handle pagination for you, and will return a list of all results.

#### Usage:
```python
api.bulk_request(endpoint_response, requests_per_second, results_to_fetch)
```
| Parameter           | Required | Description                                                   | Type     |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| endpoint_response   | Yes      | The called API function, which returns a list of data models. | ``List`` |
| requests_per_second | No       | The number of requests per second to make                     | ``int``  |
| results_to_fetch    | No       | The number of results to fetch                                | ``int``  |

#### Responses
| Code | Title                 | Model                                                                                                        |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 200  | Success               | Data Model                                                                                                   |
| 400  | Bad Request           | [Error](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#Error-Classes) 
| 401  | Unauthorized          | [Error](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#Error-Classes) |
| 403  | Forbidden             | [Error](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#Error-Classes) |
| 404  | Not Found             | [Error](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#Error-Classes) |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | [Error](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#Error-Classes) |

Here is an example of how to use ``bulk_request``:

```python
recent_blocks_since = api.bulk_request(api.block.blocks_by_date(added_after='2022-01-01 00:00:00', limit=500))

print(len(recent_blocks_since))

>>> 500
```

## SDK Extras
The following methods are available as extras to the Transpose SDK. 

You can import extras to your project by using:
```python
from transpose.extras import <MODULE>
```

Some extras will require additional dependencies to be installed. If you are missing dependencies, the SDK will throw a `TransposeDependencyError` when you try to import the extra. This error will tell you what dependencies are missing, and give you the exact command to install them:

```shell
transpose.src.util.errors.TransposeDependencyError: Missing Dependencies. You can install these via `pip install plotly pandas kaleido`
```

### Plotting
<details>
<summary>Transpose Plotting Specifications</summary>

The SDK natively includes a plotting library which implements [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/). Using it, you can quickly create plots of data obtained through the Transpose API.

For a plotting example, check out the [demo](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/blob/main/demo/plotting.py) file, which will graph the past hour's gas prices in a bar chart.

![chart](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/images/plotting.png?fw)

#### Usage
You'll first need to install the plotting dependencies using:
```shell
pip install plotly pandas kaleido
```

Instantiating a new plot is as simple as importing the ``Plot`` class and instantiating it:

```python
from transpose.extras import Plot
chart = Plot(title="Hourly Gas Prices on Ethereum")
```

This will return an object on which you can call the following methods:

- ``Plot.plotly()``
  - Returns the current plot as a plotly object. From there, you can further customize the plot.
  
- ``Plot.show()``
  - Renders the current plot in the browser. This plot is interactive, and can be zoomed and panned.
  
- ``Plot.render(path, format)``
  - Inputs:
    - ``path`` -> The path to render the plot to.
    - ``format`` -> The format to render the plot as. Can be either ``png``, ``html``, ``jpg``, etc.

- ``Plot.add_data(data, type, shape, smoothing)``

  - Inputs:
    - ``data`` -> The data to add to the plot. Takes the following format:
      
      ```json
      {
        "x":       [],                   // List of data
        "y":       [],                   // List of data
        "y_axis":  "Gas Price (Gwei)",   // OPTIONAL: The name of the y-axis
        "x_axis":  "Time",               // OPTIONAL: The name of the x-axis
      }
      ```
    - ``type`` -> OPTIONAL: The method used to render the data to the plot. Can be either ``line`` or ``bar``.
    - ``shape`` -> OPTIONAL: The shape of the line. Can be either ``linear``, ``spline``, ``vh``, ``hv``, ``vhv``, or ``hvh``.
    - ``smoothing`` -> OPTIONAL: The number of points to smooth the data with.
      - For ``line``, this will calculate a moving average of the data with a period of ``smoothing``.
      - For ``bar``, this will group and average the data over ``smoothing`` points.
</details>

## Making a Request

To get started and make your first request, make a new `Transpose` object:

```python
from transpose import Transpose

api = Transpose('transpose_api_key')
```

From there, you can call endpoints from the `api.nft`, `api.ens`, `api.token`, and `api.block` subclasses.

### Debugging Requests

You can view the raw HTTP requests the SDK is making by setting the `debug` flag to `True` when creating a new `Transpose` object. For example: 
```python
from transpose import Transpose

api = Transpose('transpose_api_key', debug=True)
```

## Simple Demo

To show just how powerful our data is, let's get the last ENS domain that expired. All we need is one API call.
```python
from transpose import Transpose

api = Transpose('transpose_api_key')

# get the most recently expired ENS domain
last_expired = api.ens.records_by_date(type='expiration', order='desc', limit=1)
```

This returns a list of [ENS Records](https://github.com/TransposeData/transpose-python-sdk/tree/main/docs/ens.md#ENS-Record-Model), which includes data which you wouldn't be able to easily get from the ENS protocol.

```json
[

    "ens_name":"game-master-dit-gm.eth",
